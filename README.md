# Job Matching IR Engine: Location-Aware Semantic Search System

## Introduction
   
In today's complex job market, job seekers face the challenge of finding positions that not only match their technical skills but also align with their location preferences and career aspirations. Our Information Retrieval (IR) system revolutionizes job searching by enabling natural language queries that encompass comprehensive job preferences, including company culture, benefits, work environment, and specific technical requirements.

Our system's significance lies in its ability to process and understand complex, multi-faceted queries such as "What types of senior software engineering roles are available in New York at global tech companies that emphasize a collaborative work culture?" This approach represents a significant advancement over traditional keyword-based job search systems by incorporating:


* Location-aware search functionality
* Integration of traditional IR with modern neural methods
* Comprehensive evaluation across multiple ranking approaches
* Scalable architecture supporting large job datasets

The system addresses several key challenges in modern job searching:
* Understanding complex, natural language queries that combine multiple aspects of job preferences
* Processing unstructured job descriptions to extract meaningful information
* Matching location preferences with standardized location data
* Ranking results based on multiple dimensions of relevance
